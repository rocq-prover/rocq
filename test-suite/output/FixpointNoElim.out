The command has indeed failed with message:
Recursive definition of bar is ill-formed.
Cannot define a fixpoint
with principal argument living in sort "Type@{α3 ; Set}"
to produce a value in sort "Prop"
because "Type@{α3 ; Set}" does not eliminate to "Prop".
Recursive definition is: "fun _ : foo => I".
